Notes App in SwiftUI using SwiftData

Notes App

Welcome to the Notes app built using SwiftUI and the revolutionary SwiftData framework introduced in WWDC 2023. This app allows you to create, view, edit, and delete notes, all while leveraging the power and simplicity of SwiftUI with the efficiency of SwiftData for data management.

Requirements

Xcode 14 (or later)
iOS 16 (or later)
SwiftData 1.0
Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in Xcode 14 or a later version.
Ensure that you have SwiftData 1.0 installed in your Xcode project. You can add it as a Swift package dependency or use other preferred methods like CocoaPods or Carthage.
Build and run the app on the iOS 16 simulator or a physical device.
Features

1. Notes List
The Notes app opens up to a clean and minimalistic list view that displays all the notes you've created. Each note card in the list contains a preview of the note's content, creation date, and last modified date.

2. Create a New Note
To create a new note, simply tap on the "New Note" button located at the top right corner of the Notes List. This will navigate you to the Note Editor view, where you can start typing your note's content.

3. Note Editor
The Note Editor provides a user-friendly interface to write and format your notes. You can use SwiftUI's rich text capabilities to add headings, bold text, italics, bullet points, and more. The editor automatically saves your work as you type, ensuring you never lose your progress.

4. Note Details
Tap on any note in the Notes List to view its full details. Here, you can see the complete content of the note, as well as the creation and modification dates. You can also edit the note from this view by tapping the "Edit" button.

5. Edit Note
In the Edit Note view, you can modify the note's content and update it as needed. All changes are saved instantly, and you can return to the Notes List by tapping the "Done" button.

6. Delete Note
If you wish to delete a note, swipe left on the note card in the Notes List to reveal the "Delete" button. Confirm your decision, and the note will be removed from the list.

How SwiftData Works

SwiftData is a groundbreaking data management framework introduced in WWDC 2023. It provides seamless integration with SwiftUI and simplifies data management tasks. The framework efficiently handles the storage, retrieval, and synchronization of data, making it an ideal choice for building modern iOS apps.

In the Notes app, SwiftData is used to handle the local storage of notes and their content. It ensures that your notes are saved securely and provides a smooth user experience.
